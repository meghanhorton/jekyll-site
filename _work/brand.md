Setting the standard for brand usage across campus, this overhaul tackled the brand guidelines as much as the site design.

    <p><strong>It's hard to tell others how to represent the brand when you're not doing it yourself.</strong> The overhaul of the Brand website came as a result of a brand update that reflects the changing digital world.</p>

      <div class="explainer-details">
        <p>Although updated brand guidelines existed for the newest iteration of the Cornell brand, prior to the launch of the redesign, those rules did not exist in any accessible environment. The process of developing the site was more than just creating a shell for content, but an exercise in developing easy to follow guides for usage across the University while demonstrating it in our own design.</p>

      <div class="explainer-details">
        <p>Gone are the days of an unchangeable and published brand. The digital environment has created a need for continually adapting and fluid brand guidelines. From colors that need to be adapted for accessibility, to logo restrictions for various screensizes, to clarifications for rules when a new condition is created, the brand guide is no longer a static piece of content, but a living document.</p>
