Since it's launch, over 70,000 visitors have used the "itinerary builder" to plan a customized visit on campus. This <a href="http://www.case.org/Awards/Circle_of_Excellence/About_COE/Previous_Winners/2015_Winners/Websites_2015.html" target="_blank">award-winning tool</a> has paved the way for countless other event management opportunities on campus.

    <p><strong>As a generation of students who have only known a world with internet enters higher education, there is an increased need for a virtual welcome mat.</strong> Prior to the launch of <a target="_blank" href="http://cornell.edu/visit">cornell.edu/visit</a>, the process for planning a visit to campus involved at least one phone call and a very generalized experience.</p>

        <p>With thousands of prospective students visiting Cornell nearly every day of the year, the Visitor Relations office was constantly busy with organizing tours, class visits, and other events for visitors embarking on a trip to campus. With "Itinerary Builder," as we named it internally, the online tool helps visitors manage their own visits and the University manage attendance numbers, resources, and other hard to track data points for physical visits to campus.</p>

        <p>The primary use for the "itinerary builder" started with the "Visit 365" experience - daily visits to Cornell. But when departments on campus realized it's success, it became a reusable tool to be repurposed for countless events on campus &ndash; from reunion, to homecoming, to admitted students weekend.</p>
