Designed with the user in mind, the new Chronicle experience provides readers with more lateral movement across the site to discover more relevant articles and puts the emphasis on content.

    <p><strong>The voice of the University must be heard.</strong> For much of Cornell University's 150+ year history, the Cornell Chronicle has served as the news source for official communications &mdash; a megaphone for promoting the University community's accomplishments across the globe to an average of 140,000 unique users per month.</p>

        <p>Through user studies of the previous iteration of the Cornell Chronicle website, one major pain point for users was proved to be lateral movement between stories. Through a combination of design elements and integrated components, it's easier for users to discover stories they want to read.</p>
