We've all heard it before &ndash; *don't reinvent the wheel*.

[GitHub](https://github.com/showcases) is home to millions of repositories of code that other designers and developers have painstakingly put their blood, sweat, and tears into. With those resources literally at your fingertips, it doesn't seem to make sense to create something new &ndash; it's quite likely that someone's already done the work.

So, why would anyone *reinvent* the proverbial wheel? 

## It's just too complicated

Very few programmers write [and release] a plugin or framework that does just one thing. Usually, a package or tool relies on tons of code to do many things, but sometimes you just need one. 

In this case, it's ok to reinvent the wheel. Create your own simple code to do exactly what you need and, if you're working in the web world, you might save your user some data or processing power. 

## It doesn't exist yet

You want to create something that does X using Y and Z, but nobody's written it yet. Perhaps you're doing something super specific to your environment that, in combination, is used by very few people. 

In this case, it's ok to reinvent the wheel. And, if you're feeling nice, share it with the world!

## You want to learn.

**Here it is. It's what you've been waiting for.** This is my reason.

I wrote my own [HTML/CSS framework](https://github.com/meghanhorton/framework) in a world of more HTML/CSS frameworks than anyone could have ever imagined because _I wanted to learn_. 

From the day I discovered [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), to the moment my love/hate relationship with [Foundation for Email](https://foundation.zurb.com/emails.html) began, I've started to rely on HTML frameworks for every project I start. 

Sure, I have a good understanding of HTML5 elements and I write SASS in my dreams, but there was definitely a level of understanding that I felt like I was missing. 

Newer components, like [flexbox](http://flexboxfroggy.com/), left me feeling like I needed to do some catching up. 

So I started (almost) from scratch. In all honesty, I borrowed a few [mixins](http://sass-lang.com/guide) from Bootstrap here and there, but I didn't do so without fully understanding what I was writing and implementing.

> It left me with a feeling of pride, ownership, and a hint of "oh no, I hope no one else stumbles upon this just yet."

Will I try to get the rest of the world to use it? Unlikely. Will I use it on another project (beyond this one)? _Absolutely_.
